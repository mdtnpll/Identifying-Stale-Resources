This AWS Lambda function identifies unused EBS snapshots that are no longer linked to active EC2 instances and deletes them to optimize storage costs.

Process:
Fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the account (self).
Retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped).
Checks each snapshot's associated volume to determine if it's linked to an active instance.
Deletes stale snapshots to reduce storage costs and improve AWS resource efficiency.
Would you like me to add Python code for this Lambda function? ðŸš€

Identifying Stale EBS Snapshots
In this example, we'll create a Lambda function that identifies EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.

Description:
The Lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ('self') and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is not associated with any active instance. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.
