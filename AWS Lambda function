This AWS Lambda function identifies unused EBS snapshots that are no longer linked to active EC2 instances and deletes them to optimize storage costs.

Process:
Fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the account (self).
Retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped).
Checks each snapshot's associated volume to determine if it's linked to an active instance.
Deletes stale snapshots to reduce storage costs and improve AWS resource efficiency.
Would you like me to add Python code for this Lambda function? ðŸš€
